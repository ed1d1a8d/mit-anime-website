Club Membership
---------------

**Overview**

While all of our showings are free to MIT students and staff, there are
benefits to becoming an official club member. Becoming a member is free
and commitment-free and simply allows us to keep better number of the
individuals that we serve, for accounting purposes.

Members receive a member identification card, which expires four years
from date of issue. This card allows members to enter club raffles for
free prizes and to gain discounts at local anime-related stores.
Additionally, only MIT students with a current club membership may vote
in elections.

Membership alone does not entitle one to check out items from the
library, however; for that information, please check out our page on
[library rules.](../library/rules)

**Discounts**
Currectly MIT Anime Club does not have discount offers with nearby stores.
